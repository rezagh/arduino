** Arduino Uno **

You will use digital pin modes when dealing with signals that are either "on" or "off", high or low, such as an LED, a switch, or another digital IC. Analog inputs are used when you want to read the voltage potential of something. This is typically used to read analog sensors.


Analog Pins: The pins A0 to A5 are used as an analog input and it is in the range of 0-5V.

Digital Pins: The pins 0 to 13 are used as a digital input or output for the Arduino board.

Serial Pins: These pins are also known as a UART pin. It is used for communication between the Arduino board and a computer or other devices. The transmitter pin number 1 and receiver pin number 0 is used to transmit and receive the data resp.

External Interrupt Pins: This pin of the Arduino board is used to produce the External interrupt and it is done by pin numbers 2 and 3.

PWM Pins: This pins of the board is used to convert the digital signal into an analog by varying the width of the Pulse. The pin numbers 3,5,6,9,10 and 11 are used as a PWM pin.
